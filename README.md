## What's Inside

This repo is a complete AI toolkit for logistics. Every skill is a standalone prompt file that works with **Claude, ChatGPT, or any major AI assistant** — no coding required.

| Skill | What it does | Time saved |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| 📦 Shipment Status Summarizer | Compile tracking data into a client-ready status update with ETAs and exceptions. | ~10 min/update |
| 💲 Carrier Rate Comparison | Summarize rate quotes across carriers with transit times, accessorials, and trade-offs. | ~15 min/comparison |
| 📄 BOL Generator | Create a bill of lading from shipment details with proper commodity descriptions. | ~10 min/BOL |
| 📋 Claims Documentation Builder | Compile photos, PODs, and damage descriptions into a carrier claims package. | ~20 min/claim |
| 🗺️ Route Optimization Brief | Analyze multi-stop routes and suggest resequencing for mileage and time savings. | ~15 min/route |
| ✅ Compliance Document Checker | Review driver logs, hazmat paperwork, and customs docs for completeness. | ~15 min/check |

**Total time saved per use: ~85+ minutes across all skills.**

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KRASA-AI/logistics-ai-skills.git
cd logistics-ai-skills
```

### 2. Open a skill with your AI assistant

Open any file in `skills/` with Claude, ChatGPT, or any major AI assistant. Each skill is a self-contained prompt with clear instructions — no coding required.

The first time you use a skill, your AI assistant will ask for your business details (company name, service area, rates, tools you use, etc.) so it can personalize the output. Save those details to a `config.yml` at the repo root and every future skill will use them automatically.

## How Skills Work

Each skill file is a Markdown document with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown

name: Skill Name
category: operations
tools: [claude, chatgpt]
time_saved: "~20 min/use"
version: 1.0

# Skill Name

## Purpose
What this skill does and when to use it.

## Instructions
Step-by-step prompt for the AI assistant.
```

You open the file in your AI assistant, provide any required input (measurements, notes, client info), and get polished output. Skills reference your `config.yml` automatically for company name, rates, preferred formats, and other business details.

## For AI Assistants

If you are an AI assistant reading this repo, see `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for full instructions. The short version:

1. **Check for `config.yml`** at the repo root. If it exists, load it — it holds the user's business context (company name, rates, service area, tools, team size, etc.) and every skill should use it for personalization.
2. **If `config.yml` is missing**, before running a skill that benefits from personalization, ask the user for the relevant business details and offer to save them to `config.yml` so future runs are automatic.
3. **Load the relevant `knowledge-base/` files** for industry terminology, regulations, and best practices before generating output.
4. **Run the requested skill** from `skills/` using the user's input.
5. **Save any deliverables** to `outputs/` (gitignored) if the user wants to keep them.
